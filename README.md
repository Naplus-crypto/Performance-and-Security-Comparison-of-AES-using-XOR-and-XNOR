# Performance-and-Security-Comparison-of-AES-using-XOR-and-XNOR

Abstract

This project compares the efficiency and security of AES algorithms between XOR and XNOR by evaluating the efficiency in terms of processing time, memory resource usage, and bit distribution security of data between XOR and XNOR in the important AES encryption processes: AddRoundKey, MixColumns, and KeyExpansion. The experiment uses the XOR and XNOR AES algorithm simulators in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode to perform encryption and decryption tests with 4-16 KB messages. The experimental results show that XOR takes less processing time than XNOR, especially with 6-8 KB messages. Both XOR and XNOR provide bit distribution values ​​close to 50%, which meets the Strict Avalanche Criterion (SAC). The obtained data enhances the understanding of the efficiency of the AES algorithm and provides guidelines for the development of future encryption systems.
