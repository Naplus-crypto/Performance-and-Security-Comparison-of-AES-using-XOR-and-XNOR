# Performance-and-Security-Comparison-of-AES-using-XOR-and-XNOR

Abstract

This project compares the efficiency and security of AES algorithms between XOR and XNOR by evaluating the efficiency in terms of processing time, memory resource usage, and security in terms of bit distribution of data between XOR and XNOR in the important encryption processes of AES, namely AddRoundKey, MixColumns, and KeyExpansion. The experiment uses XOR and XNOR AES algorithm simulators to perform encryption and decryption tests with 4-16 KB messages. The results show that XOR takes less processing time than XNOR, especially with 6-8 KB messages, and that both XOR and XNOR provide bit distribution values ​​close to 50%, which meets the Strict Avalanche Criterion (SAC). The obtained data enhances the understanding of the efficiency of the AES algorithm and provides guidelines for the development of future encryption systems.
